# TODOs

## Now

## Backlog
- Command line params for size of window
- Refactoring
  - Go through and let CLion tell me what to fix!
  - Pull SDL stuff into the App class and call it SDLApp
- Headless mode?
- Use futures rather than using threads directly
- Nicer colours
  - Cubic interpolation over some pre-chosen nice colours?
- Render Mandie on the graphics card!

## Icebox
- Don't render mandie on the UI thread!
  - Basically I don't know how to effectively do concurrency in modern C++ yet
